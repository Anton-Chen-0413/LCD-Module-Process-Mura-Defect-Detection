# LCD-Module-Process-Mura-Defect-Detection
 Use Laplacian Of Gaussian function filter to generate 3 types of convolution and detect 3 types of mura respectively. The first type: 2D 3x3 convolution to detect defect point and line mura. Type 2: 1D 1x15 convolution, detect H-Band mura The third type: 1D 15x1 convolution, detect V-Band mura
